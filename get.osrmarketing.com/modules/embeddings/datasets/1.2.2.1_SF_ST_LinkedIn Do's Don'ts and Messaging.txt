LinkedIn Do’s, Don’ts, and Messaging Examples
What Not to Do
* Impersonal “canned” and only focused on you (the seller)
* Lacking Benefits
* Lacking information on why they should care (Why is this important)
* Too long (over 50 words)
* Bland subject line
* Too pushy/nagging
* Sent to the wrong person
* Not following up
* Treating social networks as promotional channels
What To Do
* Be sure to ask them about their business BEFORE talking about your own. 
* You are not tricking them into a sales call. You are getting them on a networking call with the goal of transitioning it to a sales conversation. 
* Remember, this is your first outreach message to them. Don’t sell.
* Build the relationship. Gain their trust. And they will be significantly more likely to work with you. 
Things to Remember – Anatomy of a LinkedIn Message
> First Name
> Your name and Company
> What you have in common
> Observation – Focal Point – what prompted you to send the message
o Any connections – past work history, people, interesting thing they posted
> Resource Offer – a piece of content, something relevant
> Ask a Question – Is (insert topic) a priority for you?
> Show interest
> Request the connection, or next step
Reminder:  After you get a reply – continue to ask questions and weave them into the messaging.  Discovery isn’t a stage - carry it through the entire sales cycle/process.


Cold Message Best Practices
* Make a good first impression. Just like in life, you only have a few seconds to make a good first impression so put some thought into choosing the perfect profile picture. Then, use all the LinkedIn real estate provided. Make the most of the background picture to create an inviting environment to connect with. 
* Choose Your Words Wisely. Your tagline and summary should be engaging and captivating. It should pull the audience in and tell a story. You want to give someone a reason to find out more about you and want to connect. 
* Recommendations and Endorsements. It’s not what you know but who you know. This cannot be reiterated enough. Make sure you harness the power of your existing connections to endorse you and give others a reason to connect with you. 
* Provide Engaging Content. Give people a reason to keep coming back for more. Keep your posts fresh and interesting and post regularly to keep your network engaged. 
Flattery
People want to be noticed on social media and what better way than to notice them. This applies to personal social media accounts as well as business networking platforms, like LinkedIn. 
“Hi Jacob. I read your recent blog post and I was impressed. I’d love to connect to find out more.” 
If you’re not already connected with someone, you’ll first have to send a connection request. The kind of connection request above is perfect to show people that you appreciate their work. It shows interest on your part - not just that you want to sell. 
You’re asking someone to talk more about themselves and show you their hard-earned work and you’re praising them in the process. A response is definitely on its way. 
Reference a Shared Connection
Use the power of your connections to grow the network even more. 
“Hey John. Just noticed that we have a mutual connection in Matthew. I love what you’re doing at XYZ Company and would love to connect.” 


Notice that with this template, you’re not 100% betting on their relationship with Matthew for an “in”, you’re using the same strategy as example #1 to show that you’ve seen their stuff and that you’re not copying and pasting the same message to 50 other people. 
Stoke Their Ego
With social media, there’s an internal competition that exists to have the most likes, connections or whatever term may apply and to be ranked as high as possible. This example appeals to those who want to increase their status even more. 
“Hey John, I noticed your profile was at the top of search results for our industry. I would love to talk more with an expert in the field and get some solid advice.” 
Riding on #1 again, this example offers praise - and showing that you’ve done some research. Be sure to follow through and ask some questions if you use this. It would be off-putting if they respond, and you jump into a sales pitch. Remember that trust is earned. Show your worth, show interest, find out about them, and be helpful. 
Provide Value
You don’t want to always be perceived as the needy connection and should always have something of value to offer. Create a symbiotic relationship not a parasitic one - these conversations get ignored or deleted. 
Hi Tanya, 
I hope everything is going well for you. I came across an article that I think you’ll really like. It talks about some of the cutting-edge automation opportunities manufacturers like you are using today. 
Here’s the link to check it out - >>LINK<<  
There is a ton of great info in this post, and I particularly found the adoption metrics across the industry eye-opening. Enjoy the read! 
This template is a nice “soft push” for something that might be of value to THEM, while at the same time showing goodwill and an interest in what they think. 
Use Networking To Get You In
People don’t like being sold to. But they do like to chat. 
One way to get them to take down their guard is to position your request as a networking call. Once on that call ask them what they are trying to get better at in their business and pivot the conversation about how you would love to help. 
Hi Bob, 
I hope this message finds you and your business doing well. 
One of the things I love about LinkedIn, in particular, is the ability to easily meet and connect with interesting people to share connections or ideas. With that in mind, I thought this might be an appropriate time to learn a little more about each other and our mutual businesses. 
Would you have time for a brief phone call next week? How about Wednesday, June 5 between 2-4 pm? 
I look forward to hearing from you. Have a great day! 
Re-Engage connections
This is a great cold message to use to get to know people you are connected to on LinkedIn, but you don’t have a real relationship with. You can then parlay this tactic into the shared connection/referral play. 
Hey Bob, 
We’ve connected here on LinkedIn for a while but don’t really know each other. As much as I love all this social media stuff, I actually like to get to know my connections. 
Would you be open to a call or maybe grabbing a coffee sometime soon? Just to get to know about each other’s businesses and see how we might be able to help each other. 
Thanks, 
Carl 
You can use these people as referrals for prospects you are not connected to, but they are 
Remember to create a solid foundation in which to direct your cold mail and build up from there.
