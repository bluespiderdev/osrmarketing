Client Success versus Client Manager
A Client Success Team or Customer Success Team is responsible for proactively addressing customer needs.  This takes place from the time of on-boarding. 
The Client Success Team does a deeper dive into what the customer needs from the start of onboarding. From product or service delivery to timelines and goals, questions are answered, and objectives are met. This starts with the hand-off from the Sales Team.
This is a relationship-focused client management team that aligns the customer with the products/services needed. They work with the customer to ensure all timelines are met, the relationship is built, and less churn is happening. This is done by building customer loyalty from the start and providing a positive experience.
Steps to build a Client Success Team:
> Hire people with a skillset in customer service with industry experience (preferred)
o Have the Client Success Manager / Team report directly to the CEO/Owner
> Build an on-boarding process
> Understand the customer journey
> Put a report card in place/survey
> Make sure the program can scale
> Provide self-service resources – provide a knowledge base
> Empower those in the seats
> Have a handshake between Business Development, Client Success, and your Tech Team.

A Client Success Manager or Team is not an Account or Client Manager. They both share some of the same basic goals – to have a successful and satisfied client and avoid churn.

Client Success Team
Responsibility: Making sure that a product or service helps the client achieve their goals. Focus is to build the relationship with the client and create loyalty. They problem solve.

Client Manager / Account Manager
Responsibility: Renewals, upsells, cross-sales. Quarterly business reviews, putting action items in place. They work closely with the sales team to make sure the service/product is the right fit.
