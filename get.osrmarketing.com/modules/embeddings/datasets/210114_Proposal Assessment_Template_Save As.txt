Proposal Assessment
The goal of this assessment is to provide a representation of an individual’s existing learned vs. habit-systems, in order to establish a point of origin for the sales-training process. This information is contributory to the development of a personalized training strategy.

F-T-B
When speaking with a decision maker it is important to adhere to a base-script of “feature-transition-benefit” as it is strategically designed to naturally progress towards an assumptive close. Understanding the framework of the base-script is important as the features and benefits highlighted during conversation may vary, dependent on the job-requirements of the decision maker engaged and thus their day-to-day concerns (i.e. multi-tasking office manager vs. Director of IT and Networks).

Overall Personality/Tone
