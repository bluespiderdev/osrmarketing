Webinar Scripting

Gatekeeper

“Hi, my name is [Your Name] from [MSP name], how are you doing today? (acknowledge response).  We’re a local Managed Service Provider and we work with small to midsize businesses in the [city area].  We have an upcoming webinar and are inviting our local business neighbors who help to make IT decisions within their company. Would you be the person to speak with?”


Decision Maker

“Hi, [Prospect Name], this is [Your Name] from [Your Company]. We’ve found that our clients benefit from knowing how to better interact with their Sharepoint and we decided to share these best practices with other businesses as well. I wanted to be sure you had received the email and check to see if you had any questions before the webinar.”

No, or I didn’t receive it: “Ok, let me verify your email, is it [Prospect Email]? Let me ask; Are you familiar with us?...

Yes, but I didn’t read it: “Ok, Since I have you on the phone I’ll give you a quick overview. First of all, are you familiar with us?


      Yes: “Great! Then you’ve heard…

      No: “Ok, I’ll quickly introduce us then…

We are an IT firm based out of [City] and we help businesses manage their networks to provide your business with more productive time in your day and increase revenues. How are you currently managing your networks?”

Let Them Answer, Be Conversational

Great! In addition to the educational value, we provide our clients with webinars such as this one, we can also help you in your situation. Along with the webinar invitation, I would love to have a deeper conversation with you and invite my CEO to learn more your business strategy and discuss how we can help. We have time on [Day/Time] or [Day Time], which of those times works best for you?
