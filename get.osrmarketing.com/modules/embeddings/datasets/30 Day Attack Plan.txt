Re: 30 Day Plan of Attack:  
==============================================================================================
As we discussed on XXXX, we want to ensure that you have all the tools necessary to succeed and hit your targets.  Part of making sure that is achievable is putting in place a timeline of 4 weeks and indicating areas for improvement both on your side as the sales rep, and our side as the Management Team.
Indicated below are areas we will be focused on, as well as the action items needed to elevate you to the next level.
Prospecting – Calls, Decision Makers, Email, social media, Contract End Dates
* Your 3-month average for outbound calling is XXX calls.   You will have some days that are up and some that are down – work on the overall average to increase your outreach. 
Action:
Increase your dials to increase your overall average.  Increased activity in the prospecting side should result in increased activity in the Active Sales Cycle.  Ask yourself – If not me then who?  If not now when?  And keep pushing forward.  You should be able to average (60-80) calls daily minimum with other activities in play.  
* Effective immediately - XXXX
* Call Block
* No extensive research
* Your appointment Effective Score is the total number of appointments you booked for the month divided by the DM’s you spoke with.  That should average 10%.  You averaged XXX for the month of September and you are currently at 0% for the month of October.
Action:
Increased dials will get you through to more decision makers – you need to work on getting past the gatekeeper – build the relationship with the gatekeeper to get the proper names that you need to help you get through.  At minimum try to grab an email address, find out who is in charge, seek the information that you need.  Don’t let a phone tree deter you – try another department.  Stay in conversations longer – if you make the dial have the conversation – leave the voicemail – don’t just move onto the next call. Create your brand awareness – get your name out there.  Cadences and call blocking will help.  Call, Email, LinkedIn……




* CED – Contract End Dates
You need to have the conversations to ask the questions you need to get an understanding of the potential business.  You should focus on increasing your contract end dates to help populate your pipeline – contract end dates are critical in that they give you the tool you need to call back prior to coming due – potential clients are ripe at this point to listen to you about possibly shifting gears.  Draw out pain points and offer your services.
Action:  
You obtained XX contract end dates in September. You currently have 0 for the October.  You are either not entering in the CED or not asking the question if they are in contract, or you are simply working off repeat calls.  These can be gold for follow-up regardless of what platform you are using.
* Email and Social Media
Action:
Build your ideal 250 list – this is an ongoing effort and will provide you with a working list of targets to email information to and contact for specific marketing campaigns/drip campaigns.  You have been working on this – keep it going.  Same with Sales Navigator – if you get a bite add them to contact science or the platform you are using and get them on the ideal 250 list.  Make sure you are using LinkedIn properly – keep the momentum going with posting and sharing of articles of importance.  
Getting your cadence in place is critical regardless of what the focus is – outbound marketing, webinars – you should know what your warm market list is.
Team Approach
Everyone at OSR and XXX is there to help each other – go into each day with a positive attitude and team approach.  Growth in sales is linked to a great attitude – it allows you to accomplish and embrace learning opportunities that you encounter along the way.  Keep the negative out.  Perception is everything.

Action:
Show up – come to the table with solutions – don’t let past experience bring you down – this is about building a future of success – not looking back on what never materialized.
Call Assessments, Roleplay and Presentation
OSR, will be increasing the call assessments that we do.  OSR will be sending over a call assessment document indicating the call and the assessment.  We can use this to help with roleplay.  
IF APPLIES:  We will also conduct a roleplay of the presentation you will be doing for your discovery meeting, etc





We will work through the areas above over the next 30 days and then re-assess what we have accomplished.
Goal:  XXX, qualified, booked appointments for November (the expectations that are set in order to grow revenue and the sales team is to get XXX appointments per month – this has been readjusted for November
Metrics:
2022
Break out each month rep has completed
When you outbound call, you seed plant.  When your pipeline starts to shrink – the activity must pick up – calls/emails/networking whatever it takes.

Deals Won:
None currently.

*Verbal completed on XXX .  Please review, sign and return.  If you have any questions, please let me know.
